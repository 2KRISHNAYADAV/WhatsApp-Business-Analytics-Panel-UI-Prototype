##  Overview

This UI/UX prototype reimagines **WhatsApp Business** with a built-in analytics dashboard — right inside the familiar interface. The concept allows small business owners to:

- Track orders, payments, and inventory
- Visualize group-wise sales activity
- Analyze customer behavior and feedback
- Export reports — all without leaving the app

>  **Note**: This is a visual concept only. It does **not** connect to WhatsApp APIs or modify the actual app.

## 💡 Why It Matters

🔧 **Tool Name**: `WAB-Dash` – *WhatsApp Business Dashboard Simulator*

Millions of SMBs rely on WhatsApp Business, yet:

| Problem Faced                         | WAB-Dash Fills the Gap                     |
|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| No in-app profit/loss analysis       | 📈 Full business dashboard UI              |
| No group-based business insights     | 👥 Adds group-wise metrics                 |
| Manual Excel/reporting effort        | 📤 One-click exportable mock reports       |
| No visual customer behavior tracking | 🔍 Adds new vs returning buyer charts      |

> 🌐 **15M+ Indian** and **200M+ global SMBs** use WhatsApp Business.  
> Yet none of them can currently analyze sales or performance within the app itself. This prototype offers a practical, elegant solution.
